## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have installed Python 3.x.
- You have a basic understanding of Python.

## Installation

1. **Install Python:**

   If Python is not already installed on your system, download and install it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Make sure to check the box that says "Add Python to PATH" during installation.

2. **Install `qrcode` library:**

   Open your Command Prompt or Terminal and run the following command to install the `qrcode` library along with its dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install qrcode[pil]
   ```

## Usage

To use the QR code generation script, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Python Script:**

   Create a new Python file, e.g., `generate_qr_code.py`.

2. **Write the QR Code Generation Code:**

  
3. **Run the Script:**

   Open your Command Prompt or Terminal, navigate to the directory where your script is located, and run:

   ```bash
   python generate_qr_code.py
   ```

   This will generate a QR code for the URL `https://www.example.com` and save it as `qrcode.png` in the same directory.
